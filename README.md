# newspaperImages
This script crawls images from the landing pages of German news websites.  

# Background
During the past couple of years, the consumption of digital news has risen continously. Images on newspaper landing pages act as literal eyecatchers as they easily draw our attention. However, research on images remains sparse (e.g. compared to the analysis of text). 

Therefore, the objective of this small university assignment was to interactively visualize digital newspaper images. The resulting webpage can be found under: [https://digitale-bilder.firebaseapp.com/#/](https://digitale-bilder.firebaseapp.com/#/).
