# newspaperImages
This script crawls images from the landing pages of German news websites.  

# Background
During the past couple of years, the consumption of digital news has risen continously. Images on newspaper landing pages act as literal eyecatchers as they easily draw our attention. However, research on images remains sparse (compared to the analysis of texts). Therefore, we tried to interactively visualize newspaper images. The resulting project, which was conducted whihin the scope of a small university assignment, can be found under: [https://digitale-bilder.firebaseapp.com/#/](https://digitale-bilder.firebaseapp.com/#/).
